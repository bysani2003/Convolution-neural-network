# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Animal Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for animal classification. The model is trained on a dataset of images representing different animal species, enabling the accurate prediction of the animal species given an input image.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a diverse collection of animal images, encompassing various species such as dogs, cats, birds, and more. The images are labeled with the corresponding animal species for supervised learning.

Due to the size of the dataset, it is not included in this repository. However, instructions on how to acquire and preprocess the dataset are provided in the `data/` directory.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model employed for this animal classification task is designed to effectively learn and extract features from images. It consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The architecture is as follows:

```
Input -> Convolutional Layer -> Pooling Layer -> Convolutional Layer -> Pooling Layer -> Fully Connected Layer -> Output
```

## Training

To train the CNN model, the dataset is split into training and validation sets. The model undergoes an iterative training process where the weights are adjusted based on the calculated loss. The training progress is monitored, and the model is evaluated on the validation set to ensure its performance and prevent overfitting.

The training script `train.py` is included in the repository, which contains the necessary code to train the model on the provided dataset.

## Evaluation

Once the model is trained, it can be evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance and accuracy. The evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are computed to measure the model's effectiveness in correctly classifying the animal species.

The evaluation script `evaluate.py` is provided in the repository, which calculates these metrics based on the model's predictions.

## Usage

To utilize the trained model for animal classification, you can use the provided `predict.py` script. This script takes an input image and outputs the predicted animal species along with the confidence score.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- TensorFlow (version 2.x)
- Keras (version 2.x)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusion

This CNN model serves as a powerful tool for accurately classifying animal species based on input images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, it effectively learns the distinctive features of different animals and makes predictions with high accuracy. You can utilize this repository to train your own animal classification model or adapt it for other similar image classification tasks.

Feel free to explore the code, dataset, and experiment with different configurations to further improve the model's performance. Happy classifying!
